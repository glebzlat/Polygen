# Additions

Well, what will happen, if I make all the nodes just dictionaries? And test
parsers using files: file with the input grammar and file with resulting
nodes in json?

Replace True value in the generated parser by an empty tuple (). This will
make resulting raw tree more consistent.

Grammar preprocessor

    Add grammar preprocessor to extend directive language:

        - Curly braces to apply directive to a group of rules

          E.g.:

          ```
          @ignore {
          Rule1 <- ...
          ...
          RuleN <- ...
          }
          ```

        - @include directive to split the grammar into pieces


Configurations

    Create a mechanism to control the generator: choose which tree modifiers
    to apply, add custom modifiers, add code preprocessor directives
